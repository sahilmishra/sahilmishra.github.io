I find that in a workplace environment people often don't work on live products directly they work on representations. A figma file, an ado board, a presentation. its all good, business moves fast its what's needed.

I wanted to create something that would allow all of the parts to be inlined, feedback, design, notes so I have to mock it up somehow lol.

This document is available as I update it at the root of this git repo
